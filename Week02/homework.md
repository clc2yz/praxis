take money
identify the amount of money (count)
add that amount of money to 0
repeat until amount is equal to the amount that was given
figure out if money is enough
if not enough then ask for more money
if it is enough than subtract
you have to know how money works (list)
subtract largest coin from total 
place on table
repeat until 0
if amount of 0 or less than 0 we are done 
say thanks bye
